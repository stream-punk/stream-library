Hi there, its Stream Punk in the Booth Hat.

I'd like to present Addiktone. An easy, airy additive synthesizer. There is
almost no setting that doesn't work, while you can produce unique, rich and
sometimes slightly dented sounds. By default it pulls many stereo tricks and has
a very wide image. The rich overtones make it very present, but you can tone it
down so it plays nicely in the background.

The overtones create a randomized moving shape, you can change the amount with
the `Moving` knob. The overtones are slightly panned and moving in the stereo
image, controlled by the `Spread` knob. If you turn the `Random` knob down, the
shape of the overtones repeats and becomes deterministic. Turn it all the way up
for maximum blessings from the god of `Dices`.

The main sound-shaping comes from `Skew`, `Fold`, `Detune` and `Follow`. If you
know the `Poly Grid` these are no strangers to you. Just twist those knobs,
you'll get the hang it easily.

Lets look inside. This is our oscillator-bank, `Skew` and `Fold` are applied
here. Then panning and gain is applied, which is driven by these `Random`
modulators. The `Follower` insures that the output of the oscillators is always
in range. But the `Follower` also shapes the sound. If the followers reaction-
time is below the period of the oscillators it affects the sound.

Then there is your standard envelope-controlled, key-tracked low-pass filter
and a `Multinote` device playing a fifth for maximum richness.

Please submit your Addiktone presets on bitwiggers.com and comment on bitwish, links are
